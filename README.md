The primary objective of this analysis was to gain a holistic view of the E-Commerce operations, identifying key performance indicators and making data-driven decisions to optimize the store's performance.

## SQL Techniques Used
Various SQL functions were employed:

- Aggregate Functions for summarizing data.
- Logical Statements for filtering data.
- CASE Statement for custom conditions.
- Subqueries for complex operations.
- Common Table Expressions (CTE) for readability.
- Window Functions for calculations across rows.
- Joins to combine data from multiple tables.

  
## Insights
The analysis provided insights into sales performance, top-selling products, customer behavior, and sales trends.

In this project, we analyzed an Indian E-commerce store dataset from Kaggle, comprising 3 CSV files: List of Orders, Order Details, and Sales Target.

- List of Orders: Contains purchase information, including Order ID, Date of Purchase, and customer details.
- Order Details: Includes order ID, price, quantity, profit, category, and subcategory of products.
- Sales Target: Holds sales target amount and date for each product category.

📊 These insights can guide decision-making processes, such as optimizing inventory, setting sales targets, tailoring marketing strategies, and identifying areas of improvement to enhance overall performance and profitability.
